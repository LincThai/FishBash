Expected Content
The content you should expect is the basic level/world block out for the main area with the basic boat and camera movement, a basic fish bash mechanic, some shaders and UI. For this experience you have the ability to explore the world and catch/fight a few different fish.

Bugs/Issues
- The boat and shader waves don't match up.
- No animation in the fish bash mechanic therefore no feedback
- No other Sounds have been implemented other than the background music.
